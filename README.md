Training YOLOv3 object detection.
We'll be training a YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) model. This specific model is a one-shot learner, meaning each image only passes through the network once to make a prediction, which allows the architecture to be very performant, viewing up to 60 frames per second in predicting against video feeds.
This is the sourse which describe the model properly https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/
